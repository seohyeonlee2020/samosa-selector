**Overview**
In this lab, I will create a game called Samosa Selector that is based on an incremental game called Cookie Clicker. The goal of the game is to produce as many samosas by clicking on the Big Samosa as I can.

Gameplay

I start the game with zero samosas. When I click the Big Samosa, it initially produces one samosa per click. When I have 10 samosas, I can buy a Double Stuffed upgrade, which produces double the amount of samosas per click. When I have 100 samosas, I can buy the Party Pack upgrade, which produces 5x the amount of samosas per click. When I have 1000 samosas, I can buy the Full Feast upgrade, which produces 10x the amount of samosas per click. The game continues on forever and I can continue to gain gigantic amounts of samosas. Yum!
